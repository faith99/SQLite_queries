# SQLite Practice Portfolio

Welcome to my SQLite Practice Portfolio! This repository serves as a collection of my SQL solutions to real-world-inspired challenges. Each subfolder links to a Git submodule containing queries and analysis from specific practice sets.

## About the Practice Questions

The challenges are sourced from **[InterviewMaster.ai](https://interviewmaster.ai/)** ‚Äî a platform designed to help professionals prepare for data and analytics interviews. These tasks simulate scenarios faced by analysts in companies like Amazon, Netflix, and OpenAI.

Each submodule showcases:
- A **problem statement**
- My **SQL solutions**
- A detailed **README** that explains the task and context

## üîó Submodules

- `prime-video-content-analysis/` ‚Äì Viewership analytics for different genres on Prime Video.
- `chatgpt-user-engagement-analysis/` ‚Äì User behavior insights from the ChatGPT platform.



## Why I'm Doing This

I'm actively sharpening my data analysis skills and preparing for roles that demand SQL fluency and business problem-solving. These mini-projects reflect my progress and thought process in solving data problems from scratch.
